# BayesianFilters

Implementation of several Bayesian and Kalman Filters in Julia, based on [Roger Labbe's book and Python library](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)

I started this project in an attempt to learn both Julia programming and Kalman filters. I have implemented several algorithms but there's still a lot to add to bring it up to the level of Roger Labbe's repository. Feel free to add to the repo by creating a PR or fork and add to your own. Cheers!
